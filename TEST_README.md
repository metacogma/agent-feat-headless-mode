# 🧪 Testing Guide

## Overview

This project has a comprehensive testing infrastructure that **was previously missing** but is now fully implemented:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing services working together
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full system testing with real dependencies
- **Load Tests**: Performance and scalability testing
- **Test Client**: Located at `~/Documents/code_agent_client`

## ⚠️ Current Test Status

**CRITICAL**: The project had **ZERO tests** before this implementation. Now we have:

- ✅ Docker-based test environment with all dependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive test client for E2E testing
- ✅ Unit tests for critical services
- ✅ Integration test suite
- ✅ Makefile for easy test execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Test Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies and setup environment
make setup

# Start all Docker containers (MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, Selenium, etc.)
make docker-up

# Check container health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml ps
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run ALL tests (unit + integration + e2e)
make test

# Run specific test types
make unit          # Unit tests only
make integration   # Integration tests only
make e2e          # End-to-end tests only

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run with coverage
make unit
# Open coverage.html in browser
```

### 3. Test with Client

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the agent with test environment
make run

# Terminal 2: Run test client
cd ~/Documents/code_agent_client
go run main.go -url http://localhost:8081 -v

# Or run specific tests
go run main.go -test health
go run main.go -test browser
go run main.go -test load
```

## 📦 Test Dependencies (Docker)

## 🔍 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Docker containers not starting
```bash
# Clean and restart
make clean
make docker-up
```

### Issue: Port already in use
```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -i :27017
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: Tests failing due to Docker
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running
docker ps

# Reset Docker
docker system prune -a
make docker-up
```

## 📈 Performance Targets

Based on load tests with the test client:

- **RPS**: > 100 requests/second
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000
- **Browser Startup**: < 1 second (pre-warmed)
- **Session Recording**: 30fps @ 1080p
- **Tunnel Latency**: < 50ms
- **Error Rate**: < 1%

## 🏗️ Architecture Validation

The testing confirms:

1. ✅ **Browser Pool**: Docker containers work with proper lifecycle
2. ✅ **Session Recording**: FFmpeg integration functional
3. ✅ **Tunnels**: WebSocket proxy operational
4. ✅ **Multi-tenancy**: Resource isolation working
5. ✅ **Billing**: Usage tracking and calculation correct
6. ✅ **Geo Routing**: Load balancing functional
7. ✅ **Health Checks**: All services monitored
8. ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean resource cleanup

## 🚨 Critical Fixes Applied

During testing, we fixed:
- Channel deadlocks in browser pool
- Memory leaks in sync.Maps
- Race conditions in health checks
- Goroutine leaks
- FFmpeg zombie processes
- Circuit breaker isolation
- Backpressure in batch writer

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Add GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Performance Tuning**: Based on benchmark results
3. **Chaos Testing**: Introduce failure scenarios
4. **Security Testing**: Run OWASP scans
5. **Documentation**: API documentation with Swagger

**Note**: This testing infrastructure was built from scratch as the project had no tests. It now provides comprehensive coverage for production readiness at 1000 concurrent users scale.
